# ✈️ GE Aerospace Digital Technology Certification Project – Vue.js Product Calculator

This project was developed as part of the **GE Aerospace Digital Technology Certification**, demonstrating my ability to build interactive user interfaces using Vue.js, HTML, and CSS.

## 🚀 Project Description

The application is a simple Vue.js-based tool that calculates the product of two numbers and displays the result interactively.

### 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Vue 3 (Composition API)**
- **HTML**
- **Scoped CSS**

## 💡 Features

- Displays two preset numbers: **4** and **8**
- Includes a visually styled button labeled **Compute**
- On clicking the button, it multiplies the two numbers and shows the **product**
- Displays a relevant airplane image to reflect the aerospace theme
- Includes hover effects, styling, and responsive layout

## 🧠 Purpose

The goal of this small application was to demonstrate:
- Understanding of Vue 3's Composition API
- Ability to use `ref` for reactivity
- Dynamic conditional rendering (`v-if`)
- Styling with scoped CSS
- Structuring components using the `<template>`, `<script setup>`, and `<style scoped>` tags

## 📦 How It Works

1. Two numbers (`num1 = 4` and `num2 = 8`) are initialized.
2. The user clicks the **Compute** button.
3. The product is calculated (`4 * 8 = 32`) and displayed in place of the button.
